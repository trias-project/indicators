# Indicators

This repository contains pipelines to generate alien species _indicators_, i.e. graphs or tables analyzing specific aspects of their _stage of invasion_. Indicators can be divided in two groups:

1. checklist-based indicators
2. occurrence-based indicators

## Checklist-based indicators

Checklist based indicators developed within the TrIAS project are:

1. [number of introduced species present in Belgium as function of time](https://trias-project.github.io/indicators/02_indicator_introductions_per_year.html) shown as graphs
2. [cumulative number of introduced species present in Belgium as function of time](https://trias-project.github.io/indicators/03_indicator_cumulative_number.html) shown as graphs
3. [pathways of introduction](https://trias-project.github.io/indicators/04_indicator_pathways.html) shown as graphs and tables

The indicators are built upon the taxa published in the [Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species - Belgium](https://doi.org/10.15468/xoidmd).

## Occurrence-based indicators

Occurrence-based indicators can be divided in three groups:

1. assessment of appearing and reappearing alien taxa during the last year
2. ranking of alien taxa based on an emerging status assessment
3. state of invasion of protected areas

All of them start from data as preprocessed in pipeline [Preprocessing for occurrence-based indicators](https://trias-project.github.io/indicators/05_occurrence_indicators_preprocessing.html). The starting point are the *occurrence cube at species level* as produced in TrIAS repository [occ-cube](https://github.com/trias-project/occ-cube) and published on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3637911) and the *occurrence cube of alien taxa* as produced in TrIAS repository [occ-cube-alien](https://github.com/trias-project/occ-cube-alien) and published on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3635510).

### Appearing and reappearing alien taxa 

This analysis is performed in pipeline [Appearing-reappearing species](https://trias-project.github.io/indicators/06_occurrence_indicators_appearing_taxa.html).

### Ranking of alien taxa based on an emerging status assessment

In order to calculate an emergency index, we take into account:

1. number of occurrences per year, or simply _occurrences_
2. area of occupancy (AOO), or simply _occupancy_

The workflow is divided in two steps:

1 [Assessing emerging status of alien species](https://trias-project.github.io/indicators/07_occurrence_indicators_modelling.html)
2. [Ranking species by emerging status](https://trias-project.github.io/indicators/08_ranking_emerging_status.html)

We work with GAM (Generalized Additive Models) and decision rules to assess the emerging status of a species.

### Protected areas analysis 

This analysis is divided in three steps:

1. [Belgian protected areas and EEA grid of Belgium](https://trias-project.github.io/indicators/09_define_overlay_grid_belgium_with_protected_areas.html) to preprocess geospatial data, visualize the Natura2000 protected areas and overlay the EEA 1kmx1km reference grid to protected areas
2. [Belgian protected areas: observations and occupancy](https://trias-project.github.io/indicators/10_species_observations_occupancy_in_protected_areas.html) to assess the number of observations, the area of occupancy and the coverage of Belgian protected areas for all species and year
3. [Status of invasion of Belgian protected areas](https://trias-project.github.io/indicators/11_status_alien_species_in_protected_areas.html)
